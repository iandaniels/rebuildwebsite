1349269308|seniormoots|Senior Moots|The Slaughter and May Senior Mooting Competition is the most prestigious internal mooting competition at UCL Laws. Open to all second years and above, including Erasmus and affiliate students, the competition takes place over five rounds throughout the year with a variety of moot problems covering a number of areas of law. <br /><br />Judged by faculty members, barristers and representatives from Slaughter and May, the competition seeks to find the four best mooters studying Law at UCL to proceed to the Final and compete to be named the winner of the Senior Mooting Competition. With the Final last year being held at the Supreme Court and judged by Lord Justice Kerr, the competition presents a fantastic opportunity for anyone interested in mooting. <br /><br />As an introduction to the Senior Mooting Competition there is a short talk on Wednesday 24th October with James Welsh, an acclaimed expert in mooting and advocacy. James is the joint 'Director of Programmes' for BPP's Bar Professional Training Course and, as well as being a member of 9 Bedford Row, has been widely commended for both his publications and courses on advocacy. His talk will focus on mooting and will include further details on the competition. <br /><br />Therefore, it is compulsory for anyone wishing to take part in the Senior Mooting Competition to attend the short talk from 6-7pm in the Moot Court Room on Wednesday 24th October. It should be stressed that there is no requirement to have any mooting experience to take part in the Competition, so it is still open to anyone even if you haven't taken part in the Junior Mooting Competition. For anyone who wants to practice before the first round on 14th and 15th November there is an optional mini-moot on Tuesday 30th October. <br /><br />Good luck to all those competing!<br /><br /><br />Please see the Senior Moots Dropbox folder below for the Senior Moot First Round Problem:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9nucr9l067b96al/iYqzAPee75" target="new">View Senior Moots Dropbox folder</a> <br /><br /><br />PRACTICE ROUND <br />Date                                     Tuesday 30th October - 5pm      <br /><br />FIRST ROUND<br />Date                                     Wednesday 14th and Thursday 15th November - 6pm<br /><br />SECOND ROUND <br />Date                                     Wednesday 5th December - 6pm<br /><br />QUARTER-FINAL <br />Date                                     Thursday 17th January - 6pm<br /><br />SEMI-FINAL <br />Date                                     Thursday 21st February - 6pm<br /><br />FINAL<br />Date                                     Wednesday 6th March - 6pm TBC|<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9nucr9l067b96al/iYqzAPee75" target="new">View Senior Moots Dropbox folder</a>||9||

1339532678|administrator|Alternative_Prospectus|Choosing between universities can be difficult and official prospectuses often fail to cover the real criteria we students use to compare. For example, how good is the social life? Or maybe, how much is a pint? How about what is it <i>really</i> like to study at UCL Laws? Well, we have prepared a completely independent; composed by students, for the students; no-nonsense guide to undergraduate life here at UCL Laws. We call it our Alternative Prospectus -- the University has absolutely no control over what goes in it so we say it as it is. Spoiler alert: life here is pretty freaking awesome!

1338942759|administrator|Competitions_Main|The UCL Law Society offers a wide array of extracurricular activities for you to involve yourself in during your time at UCL. All of our competitions are open exclusively to members of the Society and thus creates a fun, amicable, and intimate environment in which to compete. Each competition is sponsored by a leading international law firm and together are highly regarded by all prospective employers.<br /><br /><b>Mooting</b><br />Mooting is the presentation of a legal problem before a 'judge'. It aims to stimulate a courtroom environment. Mooting generally calls upon your skills of public speaking, legal research, and presentation. It is an excellent opportunity for law students to develop these skills and also is a useful way to demonstrate them to prospective employers.<br /><br /><b>Debating</b><br />Debating is essentially the art of argument, a skill fundamental to the study of law. The ability to represent both sides of a case in a fluent, coherent and, above all, persuasive manner is key to debating. The public speaking and presentation skills gained make it an extremely useful extracurricular activity for anyone considering becoming a solicitor, barrister, or otherwise.<br /><br /><b>Client Interviewing</b><br />Client Interviewing is unlike any other competition offered by the UCL Law Society and has a real grounding in the practice of law. It involve you partnering with another undergraduate and interviewing a client with a fictitious legal problem. It will be your job to ask the right questions, receive the desired responses and offer them suitable legal advice. Not only will it help you develop those all important interpersonal skills that law firms are lookin for, it's a tremendous amount of fun and requires absolutely no prior preparation! Just turn up and enjoy.<br /><br /><b>Negotiations</b><br />Negotiations is one of the most enjoyable competitions that we offer. Working together as a team of two, you will negotiate your way through employment contracts, business mergers and the such in an effort to ascertain the best deal for your client. No doubt it is demanding, but it is equally rewarding. Developing skills that are required by firms, battling against your friends in a fluid envrionment and having a great time are only three of many reasons why you should get involved.|||8||

With a Halloween Ball held at one of London's most original and atmospheric clubs, an annual charity pub crawl around the Circle line and a Christmas Ball to remember, you'll have more fun than you can shake a stick at. That's not to mention the Easter Ball -- seeing out the year in style at one of London's top hotels. You'd be mad to miss any of it.|||4||
