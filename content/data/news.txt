For example, how good is the social life? Or maybe, how much is a pint? How about what is it <i>really</i> like to study at UCL Laws? Well, we have prepared a completely independent; composed by students, for the students; no-nonsense guide to undergraduate life here at UCL Laws. We call it our Alternative Prospectus -- the University has absolutely no control over what goes in it so we say it as it is. Spoiler alert: life here is pretty freaking awesome!

1338977775|administrator|ProBono|<center><u><b>UCL and the Law School Challenge 2016!</b></u></center><br /><br />This year for the first time ever, UCL as an entire university is taking part in the Law School Challenge. Although it is called the "Law" School Challenge, it really is a competition that any UCL student from any faculty is encouraged to participate in.  As the name can be misleading, I would like to refer to it as merely the "Pro Bono Challenge" when advertising this to non-law students.<br /><br /> It is a nationwide fundraising competition between universities and sixth form colleges all around the nation. The aim of the challenge is to raise awareness for the importance of pro bono work and money for the two charities LawWorks and the Bar Pro Bono Unit. (Information about the Law School Challenge: https://www.lawworks.org.uk/solicitors-and-volunteers/get-involved/law-schools-and-student-pro-bono/law-school-challenge-201516 )<br /><br /> Up until March the 3rd, UCL has the opportunity to run multiple fundraising events in an attempt to raise as much money as possible. The winning team last year was King's College, raising just under &pound2,000! Whichever university wins, receives an Attorney General Student Award at a ceremony at the House of Commons.<br /><br /> As of the 31st of January, UCL was in the lead of the competition. We have raised just under &pound1,100!! The University of Law is, however, close on our heels and now we need the support of everyone if we want to bring this award to UCL.<br /><br />Before the challenge concludes, we have a bake sale, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/653689941439111">film screening</a> and a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/472529526268160">pub quiz</a> planned, to which all UCL students are warmly invited.<br /><br />You can support our cause by making a small donation<a href="http://virginmoneygiving.com/team/ucllaws"> here</a><br /><br /> Thank you very much!!<br />Julia - Pro Bono Officer<br /><br /><center><u><b>What is Pro Bono?</b></u></center><br /><br />Pro Bono means "For the Public Good". You may have heard the term used to refer to lawyers working for free for clients who would otherwise not be able to afford their services, but it also encompasses a wide range of voluntary projects, using the law and legal knowledge as an effective instrument for social change. These include community outreach, public legal education, fundraising and working in partnership with legal charities, mentoring, active casework and campaigning. <br />As law students in London, there are countless opportunities for you to get involved in Pro Bono. As one of the world's most populated cities, there is plenty of need, and as students, we are extremely well placed to meet that need.<br /><br /><br /><center><u><b>UCL Law Pro Bono Projects:</b></u></center><br /><br />The Student Law Society works together with the  <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/accesstojustice" target="new">Faculty's Centre for Access to Justice</a> to provide students with opportunities to get involved in a range of activities and projects. While we have a core programme of activities, many new or one-off opportunities arise through out the year. <br /><br />To keep up to date with Pro Bono Opportunities, <b>please join the dedicated <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/accesstojustice/pro-bono-projects" target="new">UCL Laws Pro Bono page</a>.</b><br /><br />For a list of pro bono opportunities open, please check our <a href="http://probonoblog.laws.ucl.ac.uk">Pro Bono blog</a>. <br />If you would like to be involved in or find out more about any of the projects below, please let me know (<a href="mailto:Julia.martens.14@ucl.ac.uk">Julia Martens, Pro Bono Officer</a>).<br /><br /><br /><b>UCL Legal Clinic at the Guttmann Centre </b><br />*New for 15/16*<br /><br />In the 2015/2016 academic year, UCL Laws will be launching a new legal clinic based in the Sir Ludwig Guttmann Health and Wellbeing Centre in the former Olympic Park. This clinic will offer face to face general advice on any legal topic as well as specialist legal advice in family, employment, and housing to members of the local community most in need of assistance. The clinic will also be part of the Faculty's world leading access to justice research agenda. Roles in this clinic will include:<br /><br />    Clinic receptionists: managing the clinic reception to be the first point of contact for those seeking advice <br />    General and Specialist Advice Session Advisers: working in pairs under the supervision of a qualified lawyer, students will provide both general and specialist legal advice directly to clients. <br />    Clinic Research Assistants: responsible for data collection and conducting interviews with individuals taking part in the research. <br /><br />Working in the Guttmann, students will gain valuable hands on experience and develop a greater understanding of legal needs while providing a much needed service to one of England's most deprived boroughs. <br /><br />For more information about the clinic and how to apply please visit <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/accesstojustice/pro-bono-projects/guttmann-howtoapply">this page</a><br />Please note, the deadline for applications will be 14 October 2015, 5pm <br /><br /><br /><b>Buddy Days with IntoUniversity</b><br />The aim of this project is to 'inspire secondary school students to view university as a viable opportunity and help them fulfil their full potential'.

Each UCL student is paired up with 2 school students for the day and they conduct tours on campus, give presentations and conduct workshops.<br /><br />The 2015 Buddy Days will take place on 7th October (training), 4th November, and 18th November. <br /><br />To apply please contact UCL Student Law Society Pro Bono Officer <a href="mailto:julia.martens.14@ucl.ac.uk"> Julia Martens </a><br /><br />For more information: <a href="http://www.intouniversity.org/"> IntoUniversity </a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Public Legal Education Schools Project</b><br /><u>What is the project?</u> What if you are 16 and get kicked out of your house?

1338942759|administrator|Competitions_Main|The UCL Law Society offers a wide array of extracurricular activities for you to involve yourself in during your time at UCL. All of our competitions are open exclusively to members of the Society and thus creates a fun, amicable, and intimate environment in which to compete. Each competition is sponsored by a leading international law firm and together are highly regarded by all prospective employers.<br /><br /><b>Mooting</b><br />Mooting is the presentation of a legal problem before a 'judge'. It aims to stimulate a courtroom environment. Mooting generally calls upon your skills of public speaking, legal research, and presentation. It is an excellent opportunity for law students to develop these skills and also is a useful way to demonstrate them to prospective employers.<br /><br /><b>Debating</b><br />Debating is essentially the art of argument, a skill fundamental to the study of law. The ability to represent both sides of a case in a fluent, coherent and, above all, persuasive manner is key to debating. The public speaking and presentation skills gained make it an extremely useful extracurricular activity for anyone considering becoming a solicitor, barrister, or otherwise.<br /><br /><b>Client Interviewing</b><br />Client Interviewing is unlike any other competition offered by the UCL Law Society and has a real grounding in the practice of law. It involve you partnering with another undergraduate and interviewing a client with a fictitious legal problem. It will be your job to ask the right questions, receive the desired responses and offer them suitable legal advice. Not only will it help you develop those all important interpersonal skills that law firms are lookin for, it's a tremendous amount of fun and requires absolutely no prior preparation! Just turn up and enjoy.<br /><br /><b>Negotiations</b><br />Negotiations is one of the most enjoyable competitions that we offer. Working together as a team of two, you will negotiate your way through employment contracts, business mergers and the such in an effort to ascertain the best deal for your client. No doubt it is demanding, but it is equally rewarding. Developing skills that are required by firms, battling against your friends in a fluid envrionment and having a great time are only three of many reasons why you should get involved.|||8||

The solicitors programme is the most extensive and is operated in conjunction with the UCL Careers Service. To keep track of this lengthy list of events we have posted all of our events below in the embedded calendar.

With a Halloween Ball held at one of London's most original and atmospheric clubs, an annual charity pub crawl around the Circle line and a Christmas Ball to remember, you'll have more fun than you can shake a stick at. That's not to mention the Easter Ball -- seeing out the year in style at one of London's top hotels. You'd be mad to miss any of it.|||4||
