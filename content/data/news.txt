1338942759|administrator|Competitions_Main|The UCL Law Society offers a wide array of extracurricular activities for you to involve yourself in during your time at UCL. All of our competitions are open exclusively to members of the Society and thus creates a fun, amicable, and intimate environment in which to compete. Each competition is sponsored by a leading international law firm and together are highly regarded by all prospective employers.<br /><br /><b>Mooting</b><br />Mooting is the presentation of a legal problem before a 'judge'. It aims to stimulate a courtroom environment. Mooting generally calls upon your skills of public speaking, legal research, and presentation. It is an excellent opportunity for law students to develop these skills and also is a useful way to demonstrate them to prospective employers.<br /><br /><b>Debating</b><br />Debating is essentially the art of argument, a skill fundamental to the study of law. The ability to represent both sides of a case in a fluent, coherent and, above all, persuasive manner is key to debating. The public speaking and presentation skills gained make it an extremely useful extracurricular activity for anyone considering becoming a solicitor, barrister, or otherwise.<br /><br /><b>Client Interviewing</b><br />Client Interviewing is unlike any other competition offered by the UCL Law Society and has a real grounding in the practice of law. It involve you partnering with another undergraduate and interviewing a client with a fictitious legal problem. It will be your job to ask the right questions, receive the desired responses and offer them suitable legal advice. Not only will it help you develop those all important interpersonal skills that law firms are lookin for, it's a tremendous amount of fun and requires absolutely no prior preparation! Just turn up and enjoy.<br /><br /><b>Negotiations</b><br />Negotiations is one of the most enjoyable competitions that we offer. Working together as a team of two, you will negotiate your way through employment contracts, business mergers and the such in an effort to ascertain the best deal for your client. No doubt it is demanding, but it is equally rewarding. Developing skills that are required by firms, battling against your friends in a fluid envrionment and having a great time are only three of many reasons why you should get involved.|||8||
