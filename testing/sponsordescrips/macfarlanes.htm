<p>Macfarlanes is a leading City Law firm. We are recognised for the quality of 
  our work, not just in dealing with the full range of corporate and commercial 
  matters, but in advising our clients on their private affairs. They trust our 
  judgement and we are in a unique position to advise on their most complex matters, 
  whilst at the same time remaining smaller than our competitors. </p>
<p>As advisers to many of the world's leading businesses and business leaders, 
  we manage international matters in an effective and seamless manner. We give 
  clients a single point of contact and co-ordinate advice across all relevant 
  jurisdictions.</p>
<p>In short, we have a formidable and unique combination of expertise and culture; 
  and we rely on remarkable individuals to shape the firm for the future.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>TYPES OF WORK</strong></p>
<p>Our main areas of practice are in banking and finance; commercial; competition; 
  corporate and M&amp;A; corporate and regulatory investigations; data privacy; 
  employment; financial services regulation; hedge funds; investment funds; IP 
  and IT; litigation and dispute resolution; pensions; private client; private 
  equity; real estate; restructuring and insolvency; and tax.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>WHO ARE WE LOOKING FOR?</strong></p>
<p>We believe the strongest firm is achieved by choosing a mix of people – reflecting 
  different styles so as to meet the needs that we – and our varied range of clients 
  – will have in the future. We look for a rare combination of intellectual curiosity, 
  character and drive. We are looking for ambitious trainees who will thrive on 
  responsibility and challenge and who are ready to begin their careers on day 
  one.</p>
<p>On joining you cannot expect to lose yourself in the crowd. There are fewer 
  of us and you will be expected to play your part. Everyone’s contribution counts.

<strong>TRAINING PROGRAMME</strong> 
<p>A training contract at Macfarlanes combines hands-on experience with a first 
  class education programme. There’s no watching from the sidelines: training 
  here means getting involved. You’ll be working on real cases, doing real work 
  for real clients. As a trainee you will complete four six-month seats in different 
  areas of practice; typically it is one seat in corporate and M&amp;A, two seats 
  in either private client, litigation, commercial real estate or tax, and then 
  a seat in one of our specialised practice areas within corporate. Support and 
  guidance are, of course, vital and you will find your supervisor a valuable 
  source of information and inspiration. </p>

<p>Our vacation schemes are designed to give you a two-week snapshot of life as 
  a trainee. You will be given as much hands-on experience as possible, enabling 
  you to develop a real understanding of the firm's culture and our work. You 
  might draft a letter and then work through the draft with a solicitor or trainee; 
  or you might do some research on a live issue for a client. Alternatively, you 
  may be taken to client meetings or to meet counsel.</p>
<p>You will spend each of your two weeks with us in a different department, working 
  alongside a partner, solicitor or trainee. At the same time, you will undertake 
  a mock transaction that will run for the duration of your placement.</p>
<p>Away from the work, the scheme has a strong social component. As well as the 
  organised events, rounders with our trainees for example, or lunch with our 
  partners, there are many opportunities to get to know people throughout the 
  firm.</p>
<p>We offer a two-week Easter vacation scheme and two two-week summer vacation 
  schemes.</p>
<p>Applications are welcomed from those who are in at least their penultimate 
  year of a degree from any degree discipline, expecting to graduate or have graduated 
  with a 2.1.</p>
<p><strong>Vacation Scheme vacancies for 2011:</strong> <em>55</em><br />
  <strong>Closing date:</strong> <em>31 January 2014</em><br />
</p>
<p><strong>LEGAL PRACTICE COURSE (LPC)</strong></p>
<p>All our trainees study the Legal Practice Course at the London Holborn branch 
  of BPP Law School. You will study with those going to other firms during the 
  compulsory elements of the LPC. You will also study a separate set of electives, 
  designed for our trainees to take together so you are better prepared for work 
  in our distinctive range of practice areas.</p>
<p>Sponsorship: CPE/GDL and LPC fees paid in full and a £7,000 maintenance allowance.
