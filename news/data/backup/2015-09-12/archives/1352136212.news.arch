1350817965|Cara Goldthorpe|Searching for Beauty|Sometimes the world seems cruel and cold.<br />No truth, no hope, no love.<br />You curse this place, wonder who you are,<br />What is the purpose, point or aim?<br /><br />But take a breath,<br />And look inside,<br />For the beauty of Life lies within...|  I live in a world where there is no beauty.<br /><br />  To walk through a forest is to willingly stab your flesh with thorns. Tree trunks twist in deformed ways, and spattered yellow blemishes defile leaves. A burst of pink in the distance mimics a flower. You smile; you think you have finally found some health.<br />  But then you approach, and you see only a decaying cluster of feathers left over from a fallen bird.<br /><br />  When the daytime sky is the colour of sunset, reflecting the bloody waters of swampy fields.<br />  When the hazy glow of dawn is a perverted orange, caused by the festering fumes of polluted streams.<br />  And when the shadows of dusk are dark spirits, waiting to seduce you into a world of greed and lust.<br /><br />  Please tell me, where can I find beauty?<br /><br />                                                        * * *<br /><br />  The little boat glided over the glassy waters of the river. A crimson-painted hull bled its colour into mellow azure depths, tainted ripples fanning out like the plumes of a feathered bird, elaborate radial lines.<br />  She looked closer, into the flowing fluid, a million secrets kept within its silky embrace. But the ripples contorted in twisted lines, like the gnarled roots of swamp trees, rotting bark and disintegrated leaves forming thick, murky sludge.<br />  Up above, the sky glowed a hazy pink, the sun long set. But dust particles trapped the light, residual whispers, beautiful yet formed from polluted fumes.<br /><br />  Onwards she journeyed, as gradually the thorny shrubs of clay soil fields softened. Greener now. Verdant, tranquil green that soothed the eyes like a calming touch, or lips whispering across a sunburnt cheek, tingling weathered skin.<br />  The sky changed now. No longer a matte, uniform backdrop. For the pollution thinned, and wisps of pastel blue appeared like fingers, curling to reach out and draw aside the curtain of unnatural mist.<br /><br />  She held her breath.<br />  Gasped.<br />  Waited expectantly, impatiently, to find the land of beauty.<br />  A promised land.<br />  A land humming with a luminous brilliance, where the leaves clung lovingly to the trees, adorning them.<br />  A land far from the sickly forests, yellowed foliage, gnawed by pests. Away from the haunting, chilling darkness, seeping into your heart and extinguishing all living glow.<br /><br />                                                        ***<br /><br />  But I remain alone.<br />  I sit watching the rippling waters, losing myself in the crinkled patterns of overlapping waves.<br />  Folding over and over, intricate tessellating formations of blues, tinged by grey and echoing into black shadow.<br />  I pause.<br />  I sit.<br />  Nothing. There is nothing in me. Not a thought, feeling, or memory.<br />  Is this tranquility?<br />  Or have I merely faded to insignificance, the creases within time and space swallowing me whole, to consume a spirit with no point to existence.<br /><br />  Perhaps that is me.<br /><br />  Still, the beauty of dusk seeps into my soul. A chilly wind hovers off from the river and tingles my skin, rousing something in my heart as the whispering breeze tickles my chest.<br />  A lover's touch.<br />  Wind, air, take me away. Wash over my body and claim my flesh in your embrace.<br />  You beckon to me. <br />  And I, I will go to you.<br />  I long for you to sweep me up to the sky where I belong.<br /><br /><b>Silk v Brief is proudly sponsored by:</b><br /><a href="http://www.macfarlanes.com/careers/trainee-solicitors.aspx" target="new"><img border="0" align="none" alt="" src="http://ucllawsociety.co.uk/news/data/upimages/Macfarlanes2012.png"></a>||3||
