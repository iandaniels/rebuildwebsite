1350931071|Emma Steadman|Odyssey|This is the first instalment  of the story of a fantasy land, where 6 children who should never have met are thrown together by an event that they can neither avoid nor understand. Piecing together their different talents and overcoming the obstacles that stand in their way, they embark on a journey that will transcend the barriers of caste and culture and lead them further from their homes than they had ever thought possible.|        Tomakin was running. He didn’t know where he was running to, nor what he was running from. All he knew was that he had to keep running. <br />        Just keep running. <br /><br />	Rhiann’s father had gone on a hunt. Normally he would have taken her with him. She always went with the boys on hunting trips. Many of the women disapproved, but Rhiann didn’t care. She loved running silently through the forest, tracking the evening meal. <br />	But today she wasn’t allowed. And she didn’t know why.<br /><br />        Ea started moving again. The young boy was slow and she was hungry. If he would just hurry up they could get back to the camp in time for dawn meal. The more she trained the younger children, the more she became certain that she had never been so slow and helpless as a learner. She grabbed hold of a branch and swung herself into the closest tree, deliberately moving faster than he could go.<br />        She didn’t know why, but she had a bad feeling about today.<br /><br />        Suri was going as fast as he could. He had never been very strong and boating was not one of his favourite occupations. But in spring it was the only way to get about in these parts, and his mother needed the plant, and he was the oldest boy in the family, so it was his duty  to fetch it for her. For the fifth time in the space of seven metres, he wished his older brothers were still here. <br />        But they weren’t. So he kept punting.<br /><br />        Zarah awoke to the sound of water trickling calmly past under her barge. She opened her eyes and stretched her arms out, rolling onto her side as she did so. Her panther stirred and yawned. Birds were twittering outside.<br />        It was going to be a beautiful day.<br /><br />        Ali woke up long after the palace had done so. Six musicians entered the room and knelt in the alcove opposite his bed. They began playing their music softly, gently, sweetly. His budgies fluttered about in their golden cage and the already hot sunlight trickled though the curtains to fall humbly on his floor. The boy folded back the covers and straightened his pillows. Two servants drew back the bed curtains, lowering their eyes and bowing as they did so.<br />       He wondered what his father had planned for the day.<br /><br /><b>Silk v Brief is proudly sponsored by:</b><br /><a href="http://www.pinsentmasons.com/graduate/" target="new"><img border="0" align="none" alt="" src="http://ucllawsociety.co.uk/news/data/upimages/PinsentMasons2012.png"></a>||3||
