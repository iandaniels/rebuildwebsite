In it, she told all the freshly minted law undergraduates that they should be proud of themselves for making it into UCL Law Faculty, which is arguably one of the best law schools in the UK and even in the world. As such I would think that it wouldn’t be too presumptuous to say that all of the law students in UCL are at the very least, of a certain respectable calibre and more importantly, possess a good degree of intellectual curiosity: and yet ironically these very students will probably be studying the law and nothing but the law for the next three years of their life, if not more.<br /><br />Rest assured that it is not my intention to harp on the difference between the UK and the US education system or comparing their respective strengths and weaknesses – we’ve all made that choice. But as I write this post while listening to a very technical lecture on priority, I can’t help but wonder whether I will ever again solve an algebraic equation (or even use a calculator other than the one on my iPhone), learn about the human body or even write a critical essay on something other than the law.  <br /><br />The writings of Plato apparently cover subjects ranging from physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logics, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theatre, music, rhetoric, linguistics, to politics and government. Admittedly no one in his right mind would ever try to gauge himself in respect to Plato. However at times it boggles me how similar geniuses were able to master so many vast and diverse branches of knowledge when presently being an expert on one specific branch alone is already a major life achievement. I mean can you imagine doing this law degree while juggling modules from, say the mathematics department? And bear in mind that nowadays we have free access to seemingly limitless information through Google. <br /><br />One probable (but hopefully untrue) explanation is perhaps that our intellectual capacity has diminished as compared to our ancestors. In I586 engineer-architect Domenico Fontana aroused universal astonishment for successfully moving a 327 tonnes Egyptian obelisk 250 metre from its original location to the centre of St. Peter’s Square in Italy. His achievement was celebrated and deemed as a genius feat of engineering. Yet long before that, the obelisk was moved from its original country, Egypt, to Italy, covering a distance of more than 2,000 km; and that was done when the Roman Empire was still at its infancy.<br /><br />I guess what I’m trying to say is that perhaps if we are truly students of one of the best Law schools in the world, then perhaps we should get it out of our mind that the Law is the only subject that we are allowed to learn. Whilst the Law should probably be everyone’s main interest, I think it would also be really beneficial to always dabble in other branches and explore other interests: for instance by reading books about history or mathematics, or even learning how to code from Code Academy. Yes, doing these things might not help you to get a First, but it will certainly make you a more interesting person, and who knows that might be useful for your next interview. At any rate, this at least is my New Year’s resolution and hopefully it will be one that lasts. <br /><br />||1||
1418614077|administrator|Brian's Debut|Brian shares his thoughts on law at university.|Sometimes I can’t quite believe that I’m actually in university, let alone studying a subject as serious as Law. I can still remember how my sister and I would ride the bicycle every afternoon, pretending in a quixotic fashion that we were riding horses, ready to embark on a lifetime of adventure. I can still hear mom shouting from the kitchen saying I was not allowed to play the play station before I finished my math homework. I can still feel traces of frustration from when dad told me that I had to stop watching cartoons and go to bed early.<br /><br />It truly baffles me how somehow, somewhere along the passage of time, my life has changed from that into learning (through a seemingly endless reading list) about how the parliament passes legislation or how a valid contract is created. I now worry about the things that I will be able to put in my CV. I go to career events in the attempt to network with lawyers from city firms and I busy myself with various activities which will be beneficial for me: applying for volunteering work, helping out with the law magazine, entering mooting competitions, etc. The funny thing is this time my mom didn’t have to shout and tell me that I need to do all of these things. And during the times when I’ve had enough of work and am in need of a break, instead of happily watching cartoons alone in front of the T.V with the permission of my dad, I would have a night out with my friends – to take a break with the help of a pint or two. Sometimes I wonder whatever happened to bicycle horses in the afternoon and PlayStation.<br /><br />Don’t get me wrong, two months into Law school and I can declare it with confidence that I’m having one of the best times of my life. And the greatest thing that I’ve experienced about university life so far is actually the amount of freedom that I get. As a law student, I have a total of 10 hours of lectures and tutorials in a week, which means that for the rest of  the 158 hours of the week I can, in theory, do just about anything that I want.<br /><br />I guess what I’m trying to say is that as we all slowly but surely enter the world of adulthood, more and more, we do things that we ourselves have chosen to do – not because we’re told to them by our parents or our teachers, but because we would like to realize our aspirations. I am sure that for many of the first year students, two months of university has been an intense experience; both in a good way and bad. But no matter how you choose to spend possibly one of the most significant periods of your life, just remember that it is a decision that you have made freely. When you are stressed out by the activities that you’ve committed yourself to or by those intense sessions of studying, remember that it is to your own benefit if you can have an impressive track record – you can always choose to take a little bit of chance and perhaps skip that extra reading to take a break and reward yourself. On the other hand when you are spending too much time procrastinating and going out with your friends, remember that it was your choice to do so – you’ve had your fun and you can’t expect to be in the same position as other people who chose to do something different.  After all, we’re all just trying to do our best here. <br /><br />With that I will leave you to enjoy your much deserved December holidays. Cheers.<br />||1||
1416765562|administrator|Make Your Presence Felt|Hugh signs off.|When I agreed to blog for Reed Smith I didn’t realise how much I would learn from the arrangement and now I sit here drafting this final entry in the firm’s offices on the 28th floor of the Broadgate Tower, with 360° views of Central London tempting me to look to my left. It has been inspiring, to say the least, to see the figurative and literal heights achieved at the level of commercial legal work done around me.<br /><br /> <img border="1" align="left" alt="" src="http://ucllawsociety.co.uk/news/data/upimages/hugh_final.jpg"><br />It’s not every day where you get the City, Canary Wharf, the Moon and a Rainbow all in the same view. That is, unless you actually work here.<br /><br />Work experience: something essential any aspiring training contract applicant will need and benefit from. Clichéd as it may seem, the best way anyone can ascertain if a firm is right for them is by spending some time there, opening the massive case files on ongoing litigation, learning from your supervisors as you chat over lunch, or even routine things like experiencing the office culture while one hangs around the coffee point!<br /><br />Of all the reading weeks I’ve had, this has been the most informative and insightful. From knowing nothing about maritime and shipping law, I leave the firm wishing that I could stay longer.<br /><br />To those intending to undertake work experiences at City law firms, I leave 3 pieces of advice:<br /><br />1.	Come with an open mind. Forget all your preconceived notions of the job - leave them in the classroom where they belong.  The practice of law is worlds apart from its study. If anything, that just makes it more exciting.<br /><br />2.	Enjoy the work. It’s a work experience, not a full time job.  You probably won’t have another chance once it’s over so ask questions, observe the process, and form opinions.  Whether you’ve liked it or not, you’re now better informed at least<br /><br />3.	Make your presence felt.  Most of your time may frankly be spent trying to figure the work out, but the work stays when you leave.  The people you’ve spent time with and the relationships you’ve built, that you take with you. Seize the chance to interact with everyone and make every exchange count<br /><br />In my first blog entry, I was asked “What do you expect from a career in law?”<br /><br />My answer was simple: “To earn a living.”<br /><br />That hasn’t changed.<br /><br />But how exactly I want to earn that living, has.<br /><br />I would like to thank Lucy Crittenden and Reed Smith’s shipping practice for this insightful opportunity. It has let me figure out if I want a career in international commercial law (I do.) and if I want a career at Reed Smith (Definitely yes, *hint hint*.) (I’m kidding.) (Not really).<br /><br />To next year’s Reed Smith sponsored blogger, all the best and I hope you’ll learn as much from this as I have.<br /><br />  <img border="1" align="left" alt="" src="http://ucllawsociety.co.uk/news/data/upimages/hugh_final_2.jpg"><br /><br /><br /><i><b>This is Hugh Lim, signing off.</i></b>||1||
1396048710|administrator|Post-election Reflections|Hugh discusses the Law Committee election process and valuable lessons gauged from it.|It may not be the perfect system, but it works as well as we need it to work. We use it to decide our fates, for we the people have the power, and we direct it, and that is where we vote. Coming from someone who has never participated in democratic process his entire life, the past two weeks have been rather life-changing.<br /><br />I stood in front of a wall with several sheets of paper stuck to it. <i> President, Treasurer, Secretary, Publications Officer.</i> Glorious names and titles proudly displayed with tables inked down each one. Should you dare choose to run, you still need at least one person who agrees that you should.<br /><br />Pondering, watching friends come and sign up, and pondering some more, this was no easy decision for me to make. Even if I dared to throw myself out there, would I dare to follow it through? With one shot of momentary courage, pen in my hand, I signed up under Publications Officer; after all, that’s what I made a name in our cohort doing, right? I write, I’m published, and that gave me strength to press on.<br /><br />Hustings was interesting. I had a speech uploaded to a Google Doc online so I could look it over on my phone. It could only be a minute long, but as I rehearsed my lines in the comfort of my own room, I realised something. The more I thought about why I wanted to run and what changes to Silky B I wanted to make, the more it took to contain my rhetoric to its artificial limits. I stood in front of an audience, each and every one of them with an active interest in the future direction of the law society, and tried the best under those circumstances to convince them of my cause.<br /><br />My four fellow campaigners put up a very competitive stance. Each one wanting to take Silky B and the Law Society to greater heights, just with different directions and policies on how to get there. All very qualified for the role as well, being involved with and having a passion for the printed word.<br /><br /><img border="1" align="left" alt="" src="http://ucllawsociety.co.uk/news/data/upimages/blogpic.jpg"> The minute I stepped into the Cissy Chu Common Room, I knew it was going to be an uphill battle. The chocs and lollies in my bag paled in comparison to homebaked cookies and cakes, McNuggets and Subway sandwiches. And the merchandise! If I ever need advice on personal branding, James, Sam, Victor and Natasha simply won’t disappoint. Badges, shirts, wristbands, tashtags - they had it all. The effort people put into their campaigns, to shift the opinion of the law society’s members, was quite simply amazing.<br /><br />And so, of the three days spent in the common room trying to talk above everyone else, I noticed a few things. Should anyone want to try for a campaign next year, maybe they can learn from my experiences here.<br /><br />1.<img border="1" align="right" alt="" src="http://ucllawsociety.co.uk/news/data/upimages/blogpic2.jpg">The voter is king. But only during the election period, after that, things go back to normal. <br /><br />2. BUT, campaigning did not begin on Monday, it started the minute I entered UCL Law. The democratic process is a popularity contest of sorts. Make friends. Start early.<br /><br />3. Complacency simply because you are the only one running for a position is dangerous. Just remember the option of ‘Reopening for Nominations’ that voters can choose too.<br /><br />4. Doesn’t hurt to find out more about the role you are vying for, if you manifest intention to run early, getting some prior direct or related experience helps as well. It cant make you more qualified for the job.<br /><br />5. Have a vision, and policies that are both progressive, achievable and something that people can get behind.<br /><br />6. Don’t give up. See your campaign through the whole way and you might discover that you did have more people who might have backed you because you reached out to them. (Thanks Andre Low for this one!)<br /><br />I did not win, but learnt more being unelected, and in these past 2 weeks, I have not reached out and conversed with this many of my coursemates since Freshers, perhaps. The UCL Law student has always been friendly and personable. I had forgotten this until now.<br /><br />To those who believed in me and my policies, thank you.<br /><br />To the new UCL Law Society Committee: the members have chosen, and they have chosen well.<br /><br />As for this lone blogger typing away, it has certainly been an interesting academic year so far!<br /><br /><b><i>- Hugh Lim Han Yang</b></i>||1||
1393682915|administrator|Temptation, Dilemmas & Self-Timed Examinations|Hugh considers the benefits of true self-assessment, and the right time to make mistakes.|(At the time of this writing, I have not received my contract mid-sessional results yet. i.e. the only exam done by everyone under exam conditions. I bet if I did receive them though, my view on our latest assessment would be very different.)<br /><br />(Update, I have received my mid-sessionals. Some went well, some could have been better (Contract Law, I’m looking at you!). Unsurprisingly, or not, my views are unchanged.)<br /><br />Temptation.<br /><br />I am sure everyone in my year faced it when we found out about the work that had to be done over the winter “break”. Sure, it did put a damper on our initial relief of even having a vacation but our legal education does not stop because the lectures do, it is a continuing act of exploration, culminating in the final challenge that is the  exam.<br /><br />What little practice we get for it, however, is thus to be cherished.<br /><br />There is a slight dilemma though. Your first year at UCL Law does not count towards the degree you graduate with. So some might ask: Why even bother? For the more career-oriented of us, we might understand that the chances of landing a training contract or pupillage before we graduate often depends on whether we have enough work experience to put in a more competitive application. Whether we manage to bag any one of those very coveted vacation schemes depends, again, quite heavily on our first year results. <br /><br />I am not quite done confusing you yet so let's continue!<br /><br />The crux of this conundrum lies where we are supposed to make mistakes and learn in the first year, but can’t really afford to because these mistakes in our practice exams may be requested by the very organizations that we want to show our best self to in the first place.<br /><br />So I definitely understand that when faced with a choice of true self-assessment compared to answering our mid-sessional exam questions like a well-researched essay, many would be tempted to opt for the latter. Or they might make some compromise and revise for a certain question before answering under timed conditions (as if we’d be able to replicate that in an exam!). I have even heard of a friend who wrote many drafts of the same question under timed conditions until she was satisfied with her answer, sending many sheets of scribblings into the wastepaper bin.<br /><br />Regardless of how you approach our latest exams (apart from the standardised contract law examination), our experienced and learned tutors marking our scripts aren’t stupid. They can identify a well-researched, polished essay from the desperation of a genuine exam effort from the first paragraph alone; not to mention how accurately we can cite case names in our answer. It doesn’t matter how you approach the self-timed assignments that give us a choice, we will probably be marked according to the standard of our approach.<br /><br />Submit a full essay this time and it will be marked like one.<br /><br />But seeing as we only seem to have one more formative essay to complete before the BIG final exam, I’d still recommend going against all instinct and resisting the pressure to constantly present our best self to really simulate real exam conditions even if it meant submitting a half marked essay to our tutors. This is probably our one and only period of our degree where making mistakes is expected, is normal, and in fact, encouraged. We fall, so that we can get up and learn, so that valuable lessons can be seared into our memories for the greater future academic challenges to come.<br /><br />Either way, our mid-sessionals are over, and hopefully our results are reflective of the effort put into our degree so far. With one more formative essay to go before our finals, I take this opportunity to wish each and every one of my readers and fellow freshers the very best of luck!<br /><br />- <i><b>Hugh Lim Han Yang</i></b><br />||1||
1389722884|administrator|The Truth About Studying Law|Hugh talks about what it really means to study Law.|What?<br /><br />Scrawled in pencil, the number ‘48’ stared back at me. Surprise, disbelief, disappointment. They hit me all at once. What was this? How could it be? No, I couldn’t receive such news now, not when I had a Commercial Challenge Final to prepare for in 4 days. My self-confidence was at stake.<br /><br />But there it was: my Contract Law (LAWS1001) first practice essay score.<br /><br />I’m finally comfortable with it now, comfortable enough to share with the world that I am only human. I wanted it all, but there’s only so much I can do. What’s more important is making sure I do the things that matter more.<br /><br />I waited for my tutor after class to hear what his opinion of a better essay was. This was important after all. The blow to my self-esteem could only be compensated by the unforgettable lessons I was about to learn.<br /><br />There’s no need to bore you with the minute intricacies of my essay, just that my format and legal analysis were way out of whack. One question that he asked did set me thinking though:<br /><br />“When was the last time you actually read a case in full?”<br /><br />I had to pause and actually try to remember.<br /><br />Studying Law, I was doing it wrong.<br /><br />Contract was the first subject I submitted and had marked. Encouragingly, my later essay marks were progressively better. Showing that I’m at least on the right track. One overwhelming month later and I’ve felt a paradigm shift in my academic attitude.<br /><br />So after all this, what is the truth about studying Law?<br /><br /><img border="0" align="none" alt="" src="http://ucllawsociety.co.uk/news/data/upimages/reedsmithblogpic.png"><br /><br />There are no shortcuts to this subject. Make no mistake, this is the most intellectually challenging (and hopefully, eventually rewarding) decision I have ever made. But Law at UCL (or anywhere, really) is what you make out of it.<br /><br />You can skim through the case summaries (or regrettably, Wikipedia), read only the lecture notes and gain a superficial understanding of law. But the law deserves so much more than that. You can do more. Immerse yourself in the actual judgments, appreciate the subtle nuances in the phrasings of legislation, explore many of its uncertain, contentious and controversial areas. And that’s probably enough for most people.<br /><br />But if you want to attain the truth. You’ll have to search from within. It’s not enough to know what the law is. Law is about history and opinion. You know the content and the contentious areas,<br /><br />Now form your view.<br /><br />Put it forth, argue it and shape the law into what you think best serves society.<br /><br />The truth is that the law is what it is, but every student must have an idea of what it best should be. And it is only through active reading, understanding, and perspective-shaping can we reach this state.<br /><br />I’m not even halfway there yet. But hopefully, before my first year here is up, I’ll become closer to attaining the truth than where I am now.<br /><br /><b><i>Hugh Lim Han Yang</b></i>||1||
1386797572|administrator| What do you expect from a career in Law?|Hugh contemplates the hiatus between what he expects, and what he hopes to gain from a career in Law.|Money. And lots of it.<br /><br />That’s what most people expect out of any high-powered career in industries that provide professional services, that invest heavily in their human resources, and require great effort for great reward.<br /><br />But money alone is not enough to power me through any sort of career. It may be the chief reason why most people get a job, to survive, to feed their families and sustain the next generation of humanity. But that’s just a job.<br /><br />This is a career.<br /><br />A career is for people who want to constantly develop their craft, to progress and improve themselves so that they may stand at the top in their respective fields. A career in Law is specifically for people who live and breathe practicing it, so that they may better serve their clients, their employers or even the justice system itself.<br /><br />Then again, I am but a naïve fresher who has barely started his foray into the world of Law, much less making a career out of it. But if my previous work experience at a legal firm back home is anything to go on, here’s not what I expect, but what I hope to gain out of my career in Law.<br /><br /><i>I hope to be constantly challenged.</i> To work on the most complex of problems and come up with unprecedented solutions that future generations can learn from.<br /><br /><i>I hope to make a huge difference.</i> To be involved in world-changing projects or to save the life of that one innocent defendant. Not to sit passively and watch the world go by, but to get behind the pushcart and start pushing.<br /><br /><i>I hope to be proud of what I do.</i> Need I say more?<br /><br />But if none of my wishes come true?<br /><br />Well, at least I will be able to pay the bills.<br /><br />- <b>Hugh Lim Han Yang</b>||1||
1369317207|Christian Brighty|This Is The Way Exams End|Christian Brighty has a different opinion than you about exams, but by the end of this article it will also be yours.|“This is the way (the world) exams end(s) <br />Not with a bang but a whimper.”  &#8213; T.S. Eliot, The Wasteland<br /><br />WE’VE FINISHED EXAMS EVERYTHING IS DONE is one of the main thoughts I’ve been having since 1:00 PM on Tuesday 14th May. In fact, I think I first had that thought at about 12:30, where, pausing from my essay on manslaughter, I smiled smugly, aware that in half an hour I would be free.<br /> <br />Half an hour came.<br /><br />This was a moment that we’d been anticipating for a solid 2 months. A time of hope. A time of glory. A time when we could throw our papers up in the air and scream YES! We’d defeated contract; we’d nailed Factortame; we’d killed easements and rode all over murder! We’d slaved away, toiling, endlessly, shutting ourselves out from the unfair May sun, until now, we were free.<br />And as always, it was a bit of a disappointment.<br /><br />There were no fireworks. No explosions. No streakers. No happiness. No bangs. No bhangra. No handgliders. No hands. No Jaime Lannister. I wish I was Jaime Lannister from Game of Thrones. No Game of Thrones. No Gangs of New York. No Liam Neeson.<br /><br />It was an anticlimax. Sure, the pub was lovely afterwards and the night was smashing, but the actual finishing of exams itself, the ending of papers and walking out of the room and standing around was a bit... ‘Meh’. <br /><br />And it always is. I remember after A levels wanting to jump and scream and say Yeah! But there weren't that many people about, other people still had exams, some peoples' hadn't gone that well and everyone was more tired than actually excited and I was very upset with all of this and  just wanted to go to the pub. The end of exams is never the utopia it's anticipated as being. It’s guessing the right side that a coin will be flipped, but over choosing which of two identical options you want. It's winning, but where the winning is less exciting than having played the game.<br /><br />The other side of this, is that I've been having withdrawal symptoms from revision: I have my masochistic hat on and want to still feel the panic and fear of trying to get things done and learnt for an impending terminal deadline. I've got a severe case of Stockholm Syndrome for easements and leasehold covenants, and it's embarrassing. I bought a textbook for next year. I know. I'm ashamed.<br /><br />The fact that there was no clear ending to the exams has definitely been the cause of that. I haven't had my closure and I feel that there is still more to do; I've not finished and there are books which still need tabbing. Not all of my highlighters have run out of ink yet.<br /><br />However, I don't really feel that this is a bad thing. I don't think that a yearning to work is going to be a problem. If anything it's going to mean that I actually use my time in a real and effective way.<br /><br />I realised during revision how much it is possible to achieve in one day. When you're staring failure in the face and are absolutely terrified about what might come up on the paper, when you can see time trickling away and know that there is nothing you can do to postpone this looming deadline, when you've managed to punch procrastination in the face and logged off Facebook and not be distracted by videos of sloths of YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0V_D4zaEpU), then, and only then do you start to truly work. You adopt a superhuman level of strength and determination that feels animalistic and primitive at its core, which allows you to focus and plough ahead despite the fear. It's fight or flight, a process which has allowed our evolutionary ancestors to live long enough to pass on those genes to us, and now we can adopt them and adapt them to a revision and work context. Through this process, which allows us to cut through the flack which normally distracts us from achieving, we can work, harder and better and faster and stronger and I'm up all night to get lucky than before.<br /><br />University is a place for learning. Not just about the substantive course material, but also about ourselves, and the way we work and our own capacity to achieve. I hope that amongst the freedom, amongst the anticlimactic whimper which we might find ourselves in, that we don't purge all memory of the last few months' slog. If we were not to take hold of this realisation, it would be more of a waste than had we not tried at all.<br /><br />A whimper might be the way in which exams end, but the World is still there to have a damn good bang at. Go get them kiddo.||1||
1366109495|Christian Brighty|The End.|Christian Brighty talks of the impending apocalypse. Or not.|The End.<br /><br />When I was a child I was always really upset that all films and books did not end like that, with those two words appearing on the screen, or on a separate, final page. There's a certain closure that a roll of credits or an anti-climatic sentence don't quite achieve. There's an ambiguity, as to whether there might be a sequel, or whether the story for the characters might continue and not be quite as happy as the final moment just was. The prince and princess have just ridden off into the fairytale distance to get married, but will they forget to arrange a pre-nup? Will their mornings always begin with a sing-along with the wildlife, or will the magical forests be cut down by a logging corporation? Will a bank give them a mortgage large enough to get on the castle property ladder? Will one of their children similarly have a curse placed on them and the cycle of "curse-dragon-prince-fight-marriage" indefinitely continue? Why can't the story end now? Why is this not "The End"?<br /><br />I have seen a very similar narrative over the last few months in Bentham House. We have finished our first year here; lectures have ended and tutorials have been completed; we have met some fantastic people and firmly planted our feet in the framework of the law faculty; we have made it our home, and that is a wonderful thing. We have completed what we set out to do. The Easter Ball and Bentham's Got Talent were wonderful climatic ends to the year and now the words "The End" should roll on to our screen and then we could ride off into the distance, happy, all about to get married together.<br /><br />However "The End" is not coming. We don't even have an immediate sequel in the works. Instead, we have a gruelling few months of credits, anti-climatic sentences, as words and names roll up on our screen and we become delirious with words and cases and revision and exams. The Easter ball was not our happily ever after. It had only just started, and that was solely a 'faux-finale'. It is just<br /><br />The Beginning.||1||
1362327417|Christian Brighty|Blackacre: An Unexpected Journey|Christian Brighty risks everything on a somewhat underwhelming quest to find the fabled Blackacre estate.|13/01/13: 23:25<br /><br />I don’t want to do this, but I’ve already made my decision. It’s a ridiculous decision, but it’s what I’m going to do. It’s a little bit like a thought which you tell yourself not to think of, but inevitably do. This idea was explored in psychologist Eric Fleming’s book ‘Don’t Think About Purple Elephants’, that when trying to get the best out of people, if you highlight in their mind the actions which you want them to take, as opposed to those which you don’t, they will end up doing those ones much more frequently than if you didn’t use the positive affirmation. But also not like that idea at all, because this is really a silly game I’m playing, and I will probably resent myself for it. I did plan that this year, instead of New Year’s Resolutions which I will never keep, I will try and set myself ‘New Year’s Quests’, which I can positively try and work towards. I don’t mean like the kind of quest where I have to escape from a theme park filled with cloned Dinosaurs (like Jurassic Park, which incidentally is a great film and you should totally go watch it and read the book), but more ‘Modern Quests’, suited to society and age. I wanted 12, but so far only have two: find ‘The Perfect Pint’ (since reduced to ‘Try 40 pints and Decide Which Is Your Favourite’) and meet David Bowie (now made stupendously harder since his release of a single on 8th January, but at least he won’t be in New York. Also, for argument’s sake, it’s pronounced ‘Bowie’).<br /><br />So this is going to count as one of the quests.<br /><br />For the past 400 years, professors and students of property law have solved more disputes and settled more legal question in regard to one or two estates than any other in the entire Common Law world. I am of course referring to Blackacre (and sometimes Whiteacre). Whether it has been “Annie holds a fee simple estate in Blackacre” or “, since a treatise by Sir Edward Coke in 1628, lawyers have always referred to the estate of Blackacre as an example to illustrate legal issues and as the object of debate in law exams. It has been suggested that the term relates to different crops, with peas and beans being black, and corn and potatoes being white, and was a simple way of differentiating between estates using a generic, fictitious name. Or so you thought.<br /><br />I have decided to go to Blackacre (and possibly Whiteacre), within the next week, so as to see law in action, and to get a tangible feel for arguably the most important piece of land ever to have existed in law, in reality. It’s going to be epic.<br /><br />14/01/13<br /><br />As it has transpired, there are ‘Blackacres’ in fact all over the country. There is one in Bristol, one in Nottingham, and one near Manchester. Conveniently, there is a closer one, and I have decided to go there. Inconveniently, the closest one is in Theydon Bois, and it’s going to take about an hour. There is unfortunately no ‘Whiteacre’ in London, but if you ‘google maps’ ‘Whiteacre’ it takes you to a place called Long Acre near Covent Garden, so if you don’t mind, on Wednesday I’m going to go there first.<br /><br />16/01/13<br /><br />At the end of the Criminal lecture I headed back to my halls to grab my supplies for the terrifying journey ahead –a notepad, a Public law textbook and some French notes. I managed to deceive a group of friends in to walking to Covent Garden with me, and on the way we stopped for sushi. I don’t eat fish, but as I was on an adventure I decided to buy some tuna maki rolls, which I ate, like a warrior. As we moved towards Covent Garden, I looked up and saw across the street, my first destination – Long Acre(Whiteacre) – gleaming like a sign in the street of London. I had arrived. It was underwhelming.<br /><br />But we walked past Jeremy Clarkson, which was kind of comparatively cool.<br /><br />As I left my friends to go and watch Les Mis, I found myself alone. I walked over to Tottenham Court Road, and stocked my Oyster Card with credit, fearing the worst. I placed it on the yellow plate and stepped through, into the deep. I used the ten minute wait to start the Public Lecture reading, while keeping an eye on my surroundings. Fortunately I was able to secure a seat for the journey as soon as I left. It would take at least 50 minutes to reach my destination. I began to doubt the quest, alone, moving at high speeds away from central London. Would I ever return? How would I cope? Why are you doing this you total tool Christian, there is literally no reason to do this at all, and you have tutorials to prep for – why? <br /><br />I sat on the tube, listening to two old ladies both talk about their “Jon” (they each had a Jon), and how Margaret was no longer talking to Shirley after the ‘Jam incident’. It truly was the stuff of legends. The cold bit into my skin like a snake sinking its venomous fangs into a rat. I read all of the adverts on the tube, and even pre-emptively took a number down for the Belgravia centre for hair loss. To my dismay, no one else looked especially like they were going on an adventure, but I was still vigilant to ensure that I was not being followed. As we moved closer to my destination, I could see fields! The fields! The glorious fields! Oh what a tonic it was to be free from the smog of London. There was still snow on the ground. How beautiful.<br /><br />And then, I had arrived.<br /><br />It was to be a further epic 10 minutes hike to reach the summit of my Everest-esque quest. Walking into Theydon Bois, it seemed to be a quiet market town, not out of place of anywhere in the country – but I wasn’t going to so easily let my guard down. I stared down a small child as he passed, returning home from a day at school, trusting no one. I walked on, refusing to be distracted by the ducks and seagulls stand on the frozen pond, one hundred per cent focused on the quest ahead. And then I saw it.<br /> <br />Blackacre. <br /><br />I ran up to the sign, and roared in triumph as I had completed my quest. I immediately took a photo, like Frodo throwing the ring into the fires of Mount Doom, the final act of a perilous journey. I then walked up the street, taking in the surroundings and trying to understand and appreciate the place about which so much law had been inadvertently written. It seemed just like a normal street. A normal place. For normal people. An old lady stared out of a window. Builders threw some carpet into a skip outside someones house. A mother and her two girls walked past, bags of bread in hand, ready to go feed the ducks. I realised how appropriate it was that this was the place about which law should be written, as law is as human and relatable as this street was. Law steps in only when we deviate from our authentic human nature to bring us back to the way in which we should act. It reminds us of the way in which we should interact with one another. It corrects our imperfect nature, trying to make us better humans when we sometimes fail. Arguably, without law, we would act in exactly the same way as we do with it, as it merely formalises our natural human inclinations and behaviours. It is made out of us. That is why it is appropriate that law is written about such an ordinary place.<br /><br /><br />ADVENTURE PHOTOS:<br />            <br /> <img border="0" align="none" alt="" src="http://ucllawsociety.co.uk/news/data/upimages/Adventure_photos.png">||1||
1360076330|Rajiv Naresh|Simin's Corner|Simin tells us about winter in Dubai, Ashurst's commitment to CSR in the region and camel-milk milkshakes!|The winter in Dubai generally equates to a perfect summer's day in England so the last few months out here have been bliss.  NYE was spent on a boat in the Marina flanked by excessive firework displays, the cost of which could have probably pulled Haiti out of poverty; new friends' birthdays have been wiled away in infinity pools overlooking the Persian Gulf; and numerous evenings have been spent dancing to Philippino karaoke backed by an oddly hypnotic troupe of dancing girls in a more 'rustic' quarter of Dubai.  <br /> <br />Many people live in a five star bubble out here but there are occasions when that bubble implodes and the reality of Dubai hits home.  One such time is when, driving along the motorway, you overtake a rusty and crowded 1970s bus full of exhausted, overall clad labourers and you remember that 75% of Dubai's population is male due to the sheer number of these men that leave their families to earn a living through Dubai's insatiable construction plans.  These men earn at most £100 a month and their pay is often unfairly delayed by months.  It is with this in mind that Ashurst runs regular fundraisers and the trainees are invited to help deliver the fruits of such initiative (i.e. bags of rice, oil and flour) to the labour camps where these men live.  I was lucky enough to be able to help out on the latest visit to a camp which housed over 700 workers and although the scene looked like a bad advert for comic relief where a minor celebrity attempts to save the world by donating one pair of shoes, I definitely gained further insight to a darker side of Dubai and the food was gratefully received. <br /> <br />On the work front I have been very BD focused of late, putting together papers on PPP opportunities in the Middle East and the competing interests of the government and lenders when they co-fund a project.  I also assist at AIPN events where lovers of everything oil and gas in the region get together to discuss the latest legal change or practical issue in their petroleum focussed world.  So now with less than a month left of my secondment in the 'Big Sand' I am focussing on the final essential tick boxes:<br /> <br />1. Drink a milkshake made from camel milk;<br />2. Get every item of clothing I own copied at the incredibly cheap and skilled tailors in Satwa; and<br />3. Somehow blag an invite to the opening of Ashurst's new office in Saudi Arabia!||2||

1358958569|Rajiv Naresh|Secondment Corner|This post comes from Daniel who's working in Ashurst's Tokyo Office. |Tokyo (22 November 2012)<br />Hello (konnichiwa!) from Tokyo!  You find me roughly half-way through my six month secondment to the Ashurst Tokyo office, and the time has absolutely flown by. Over the next couple of months I'll try to give a flavour of life as a London trainee working in Asia.<br />The office is much smaller than in London, with about 30 lawyers in total – including around five Japanese Bengoshi.  It occupies half of the 30th floor of the Shiroyama Trust Tower in one of Tokyo's numerous business districts, and on a clear day has incredible views of the city and Mount Fuji.  The team from Blake Dawson's Tokyo office also joined us after the combination, so it's been good getting to know them since I arrived.<br />In terms of work, the office mainly covers the Energy, Transport and Infrastructure ("ETI"), Corporate and International Finance practices, and primarily works for large Japanese corporations and banks.  Having sat in all three of the departments above in London, a fourth seat combining all three was ideal for consolidating past work done and also deciding what I wanted to practice in the future.<br />Being the only trainee means I can get asked to do work for pretty much any of the lawyers in the office.  In the past few weeks, I have been assisting a client with a bid for an Indian rail project, due diligence on the sale and purchase of oil and gas assets in Myanmar, and drafting a pitch to act for a Korean company investing in solar power in Japan.  We collaborate a lot with the other Asian offices and, because of the merger with Blake Dawson, with the Australian offices of the firm.<br />As the office is so small, I've been able to get to know everyone really quickly.  People work hard but are keen to socialise as well: a couple of weeks ago the whole office stopped to watch the Melbourne Cup horse race (definitely not the Grand National!), I have been bowling with clients and we have an office Christmas party coming up in December (even though the office will be open on Christmas Day – more on that nearer the time!).<br />There are about 20 trainees on secondment from London, so it didn't take long to build a network of friends in the city.  There are also a fair number of Australian lawyers knocking about, who are always keen to do something after work.  There are lots of opportunities to head out of Tokyo on weekends – and there are a number of public holidays throughout the six months for long weekends hiking or exploring the city (and also heading to Seoul in a couple of weeks).<br />Tokyo is a weird and wonderful place – the food is amazing (both in quality and variety), the city safe and clean.  In some ways it is just like a Western city, in others it is a million miles away.<br />I will tailor later blogs a bit more, but if you have any questions on secondments or Ashurst in general drop me an email at daniel.jarrett@ashurst.com, or contact graduate recruitment.||2||
1356949212|Christian Brighty|Everything Everywhere|What is EE? Where has it come from? Who is Kevin Bacon? And why does this matter?|I want Everything. Everywhere.<br /><br />Now clearly that’s an unrealistic request. I don’t have nearly enough cupboards, and ‘everywhere’ implies that those things would be in places that they already are anyway. What I’m referring to is a company called Everything Everywhere. You are probably one of their customers, even if you don’t know it.<br /><br />About 6 months ago, I looked at my phone. I noticed that the network had changed from Orange to “T-mobile and Orange”. I thought that it made sense, as they’d be saving money using the same network, and I’d probably get better coverage (I didn’t). I then noticed in September that this had changed to just “EE”. Now, I vaguely remember on my old Sony Ericcson K790a that when I connected to the internet a couple of initials would come up, and that maybe this might now be the same network they were using. Cool. That’s fine. I mean “T-mobile and Orange” was a little bit clunky, and so “EE” was a mild improvement. However, a couple of weeks ago I got a text: “Exciting News,” (a good start to any text) “EE, the new brand from the company behind Orange has launched… Orange stores have been replaced with over 700 EE stores…”<br /><br />WHAT?<br /><br />WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?<br /><br />Where have they gone? Are they still there? Do I still get Orange Wednesdays? What about all the advertising? The adverts in cinemas and the one with Samwise Gamgee from The Lord of The Rings? What about the logo? I like Orange. It’s a really nice colour. The shops were always done really well, and they had things like Dolphins and Racoons and Canaries and I love Dolphins.<br /><br />I decided to have a look deeper into the business. In 2010, Orange and T-mobile decided to merge to form the company “Everything Everywhere”. Field Fisher Waterhouse and Olswang advised Orange while Allen & Overy, Bird & Bird, Freshfields, Hammonds, Kemp Little and Winckworth Sherwood were taking T-Mobile’s back. At this moment it became the largest mobile provider in the UK, with around 28 million customers. When looking behind Orange and T-Mobile it becomes apparent that they are owned by Deutsche Telekom and France Télécom respectively, each holding a 50% stake in the company. It was determined at the time of the merger that the companies’ brands would be maintained for 18 months.<br /><br />“Time’s up” – Jeff Goldblum, Independence Day (who was also in Jurassic Park).<br /><br />What does this then mean for us? Well clearly there’s a risk of monopoly power, as a company with this large a share could easily influence the market. Does this mean that prices will go up? – Not likely. Through economies of scale EE have estimated they will save around £3.5 Billion, as instead of the upkeep of three separate brands images, they now only have one. If anything, it seems that EE will lead to increased competition in the markets, and a better service for customers, evidenced by their investment of £1.5 billion to introduce a 4G network. Now, although I don’t know what 4G is, I imagine that it is going to be at least 1G faster than 3G. Which is pretty G.<br /><br />However, solidifying the deal for me was a recent EE advert with Kevin Bacon. Now, although I also don’t know who Kevin Bacon is, I love bacon, and anything with bacon is likely to sway me. This advert said the word bacon 7 times (I counted) and ended on a pun about Bacon Rolls. I was so enamoured that I honestly wept. With moves like this, it’s hard to see how mobile networks like O2 and three are going to compete with a company that is clearly number one.<br /><br />That’s why I want Everything. Everywhere.||1||
1351201935|Rajiv Naresh|What I expect from a career in the law|This year's Reed Smith Blogger, Christian Brighty, tells it how it is. Or something like that.|As a child, with a strong love of dinosaurs and a lack of general understanding, I wanted to be an astronaut. This was based, predominantly, on a quote from Dr Alan Grant in Steven Spielberg’s film Jurassic Park: “There are two kinds of boys. There are those that want to be astronomers, and those that want to be astronauts. The astronomer, or the palaeontologist, gets to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety”. At that age, I had no desire to be passive or uninvolved with the world around me. By contrast, I wished to engage with it, be part of it and thus be an astronaut.<br />Fast-forward thirteen years, disappointingly, my ambitions now involve neither a T-rex nor the exploration of space. Instead, I wish to enter into the law. My 5 year old self would be devastated to hear that I have chosen, what appears to be, ‘words in place of action’, watching distantly through a telescope as an apathetic astronomer – a palaeontologist of things that aren’t even dead yet. <br />However, my former self could take solace in the fact that to have a career in the law is to be an astronaut. <br />The amazing complexity of human interaction is not viewed “from a place of complete safety”, distanced by 65 million years and various extinctions. Whether it is through meeting, talking and interacting with clients; advocating in a court; drafting legislation or deciding core points of law as a judge – A career in the law is to engage with the real world. It is made up of decisions about real situations and real conflicts. It is an inherently human practice, inseparable from the issues of real people and their lives. <br />That is why I expect to be an astronaut.<br />||1||
1351194562|Rajiv Naresh|Simin's Corner|Simin's possible options in the unlikely event she falls on the wrong side of retention rate! Good luck to her in her forthcoming interview!|Last week the repeated goût du jour was employment and Chef A.S.Hurst served up a cacophony of legal delights.  It started with a rather bitter first course of proof reading a termination of employment letter.  Fortunately the second attempt, in the form of an employment contract relating to the establishment of a Dubai branch, did not leave such an acrid taste.  You can understand why I was hoping for a light and fresh desert.  Instead I was served a piece of qualification pie which lead to hallucinations of a one-way 'Rejected-Trainee-Airways' flight. <br />Luckily I have been diversifying in my time out here so if I fall on the wrong side of the retention rate I will have other options:<br />International camel polo player: I had a first attempt last weekend and, although I was no Adolfo Cambiaso, I did not fall off.  My camel was called Khan, I fed him grass, he did not spit on me, we bonded.  Potential.<br />Blogger extraordinaire: With a second post under my belt and a following of at least three (parents and boyfriend) this could lead to something big, look at Alan Sugar.  Small problem, I can't write about my job if I do not have one. Next.<br />Dubai socialite: Getting paid to attend gallery openings, parties and fabulous events would be ideal.  I am pretty sure I saw Sheikh Mo's platinum Rolls by Dubai Mall not long ago putting me<br />one step closer to the inner circle.  Is it illegal to just jump in?  Further research required.<br /> <br />It seems I may need to work on the above but with the Rugby 7s coming up and a penguin encounter in the pipeline there are still many more avenues to pursue in the UAE, land of dreams.  Alternatively I could stop being such a drama queen, acknowledge the fact that the retention rates are very high and get back to reality.  Either way, I am going to get back to my Banking and Capital markets book in preparation for my interview.  Wish me luck!||2||
