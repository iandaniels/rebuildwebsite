<p><span style="line-height:150%"><font color="#333333" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who we are</strong><br />
Hogan Lovells is a top global law firm, with 2,500 lawyers working in over 40 offices in Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and the United States. Our unique balance of ambition and approachability attracts prestigious clients and creates a working culture where the ambition of our trainee solicitors is supported to ensure their success. </font></span></p>
<span style="line-height:150%"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="-1">
<p><strong>Types of work</strong> <br />
Our global diversity and wide range of practice areas gives us a strong reputation for corporate, finance, dispute resolution, government regulatory and intellectual property. Exposure to a variety of legal disciplines provides good training and development opportunities for those joining us. </p>
<p><strong>Training contracts</strong> <br />
Our recruitment and training philosophy is very simple: our continued success as a firm depends on our ability to attract and retain the brightest and most able people. </p>
<p>We require every prospective trainee solicitor to undertake the accelerated LPC at BPP London. The course will prepare you for practice in the City.   </p>
<p>Our two-year training contract is split into four six-month periods of work experience known as 'seats'. As a trainee solicitor, you will move around four different practice areas during this time to gain as much experience as possible –  one of your seats will be in either our corporate or finance group, and another in one of our litigation teams. You will also have the option of spending time in the second year of training on secondment to one of our international offices or to the in-house legal team of a major client.   </p>
<p>As a trainee solicitor at Hogan Lovells, you will be offered work that sharpens your mind. You will take on as much responsibility as you can handle relating to client work, as well as a comprehensive legal skills training programme, regular reviews and appraisals. After qualification, continuous training and development remain a priority – you will deepen your professional and business expertise throughout your career. Making the best of your expertise enhances the quality of advice we provide to clients, maintains our reputation, and helps you build your career.   </p>
<p>We are now recruiting for <strong>February and August 2016</strong> intakes. </p>
<p><strong>Training contract application deadlines</strong><br />
  <em><strong>31 March 2014</strong></em> (final year non-law students and non-law graduates) <br />
<strong><em>31 July 2014</em></strong> (law students) </p>
</font></span><p><span style="line-height:150%"><font color="#333333" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Vacation schemes and open days</strong> <br />
  We offer up to 70 places over two highly regarded summer vacation schemes and one winter vacation scheme. If you join us, you will be working alongside partners, associates and trainees for up to three weeks in key practice areas such as corporate, finance and litigation.  You will experience the role of a trainee first-hand through drafting documents, attending meetings, doing legal research and where possible, attending court.  Your hands-on learning will be complemented with tailored workshops, discussions and social events – giving you the chance to experience the best of all worlds. </font></span></p><span style="line-height:150%"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="-1">
<p>Vacation scheme students are paid £300 per week. The closing date for applications for our 2013 winter vacation scheme is 8 November 2013 and for our 2014 summer vacation schemes is 17 January 2014.  Winter vacation scheme places are open to non-law final year students and graduates and the summer schemes to penultimate year law students.   </p>
<p>We also hold a one-week spring vacation scheme in April and two open days for first year law students in March and July each year. Information including the dates and application deadlines for these events can be found on our website at www.hoganlovells.com/graduates. </p>
<p><strong>What we look for</strong> <br />
  We are looking for graduates whose combination of academic excellence and desire for specialist knowledge will contribute to developing business and taking it forward. Although we are one of the largest global legal practices, we work in small, hard-working teams where everybody is committed to our collective success. </p>
<p>As a consequence of the high profile, demanding work we do, we expect applicants to show a track record of attainment with excellent academic results from GCSE (or equivalent) onwards. Candidates should be aiming to achieve, or have achieved, at least a good 2:1 (or equivalent) consistently, throughout their studies and as their final degree classification.   </p>
<p>The personal qualities our people possess are as important as their qualifications. You need to be happy collaborating with a team yet capable of, and used to, independent action. You will need to demonstrate an ability and desire for lateral thinking, be capable of close attention to detail, and have the energy, resilience and ambition to succeed in a top global law firm. </p>
<p><strong>Salary</strong> <br />
  From May 2013, the starting salary for trainee solicitors is £39,000 per annum, rising to £44,000 in the second year. The current salary upon qualification is £63,000. </p>
